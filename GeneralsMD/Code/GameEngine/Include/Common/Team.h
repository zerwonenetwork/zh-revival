	-- We'll have a TeamDict list that is parallel to the PlayerDict list
	-- All Teams (toplevel and subteams) are in the list
	-- Each TeamDict contains:
		-- Team Name (an internal ascii str)
		-- Owning Team (or Player), by Name 
		-- Misc Flags
		-- Teams we are allies with, by name (only for toplevel teams)
		-- Teams we are enemies with, by name (only for toplevel teams)

	-- Note that Players and Teams share the same namespace, so you cannot have a team
		with the same name as a player (or vice versa). 
	
	-- MapObject Dicts will be revised to have an "owning team" rather than "owning player" entry

	-- BuildLists must also have a way to assign units to Teams, as appropriate

/**
	THE PROBLEM
	-----------

	-- there are lots of different states. (consider that structures can be: day/night, snow/nosnow, 
	powered/not, garrisoned/empty, damaged/not... you do the math.)

	-- some states are mutually exclusive (idle vs. moving), others are not (snow/nosnow, day/night). 
	generally, humanoid units have mostly the former, while structure units have mostly the latter. 
	The current ModelState system really only supports the mutually-exclusive states well.

	-- we'd rather not have to specify every state in the INI files, BUT we do want to be able 
	to intelligently choose the best model for a given state, whether or not a "real" state exists for it.

	-- it would be desirable to have a unified way of representing "ModelState" so that we don't 
	have multiple similar-yet-different systems.

	YUCK, WHAT NOW
	--------------

	Let's represent the Model State with two dictinct pieces: 
	
	-- an "ActionState" piece, representing the mutually-exclusive states, which are almost 
		always an action of some sort
		
	-- and a "ConditionState" piece, which is a set of bitflags to indicate the static "condition" 
		of the model.

	Note that these are usually set independently in code, but they are lumped together in order to
	determine the actual model to be used.

	(Let's require all objects would be required to have an "Idle" ActionState, which is the 
	normal, just-sitting there condition.) 

	From a code point of view, this becomes an issue of requesting a certain state, and 
	finding the best-fit match for it. So, what are the rules for finding a good match?

	-- Action states must match exactly. If the desired action state is not found, then the 
	IDLE state is substituted (but this should generally be considered an error condition).

	-- Condition states choose the match with the closest match among the "Condition" bits in the 
	INI file, based on satisfying the most of the "required" conditions and the fewest of the
	"forbidden" conditions.
